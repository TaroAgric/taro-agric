## INDUSTRY CHALLENGE

The poultry industry in Nigeria is faced with multiple constraints, including high mortality rates, inefficient farm management practices, limited use of data in decision-making, and poor environmental conditions affecting broiler chicken welfare and productivity.

There has always been the problem of unhealthy imported poultry products being consumed by the Nigerian populace. This is due to high increasing demand for poultry products and poultry farms in Nigeria not being able to meet with the high demand for the product.

## OUR SOLUTION

Our company contributes her quota in putting an end to the consumption of unhealthy, chemically preserved imported poultry products in Nigeria by establishing an IoT based smart poultry farm with networks of rural poultry farmers large enough to meet up demand for affordable and hygienic broiler meat (chicken) products.

## Our Unique Selling Proposition

The Taro Agric model stands out as a transformational business model that has redefined smart poultry farming business in Nigeria. Our goal is to be a trailblazer in integrating IoT, data analytics, and real-time monitoring systems into poultry production, significantly reducing mortality rates, improving productivity, and boosting profitability. This pioneering approach makes it a model for sustainable agribusiness in Nigeria, Africa and beyond.

Unlike traditional poultry farming models, the introduction of an IoT-enabled farm monitoring, allows real-time tracking of environmental conditions and broiler health, and predictive analytics enabling data-driven decision-making to prevent losses.

Projected Transformational outcomes include increase in turnover and rise in profitability, significant reduction in broiler mortality rates to ensure higher yields.

Empower rural poultry farmers, equipping them with smart farming skills and many student-led research projects (initiated at OAU) with access to real time data.
